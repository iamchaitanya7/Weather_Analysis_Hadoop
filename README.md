## Overview

This project demonstrates how to perform weather analysis using Hadoop and Java. It involves processing large volumes of weather data to extract useful insights and generate meaningful reports. Hadoop is a distributed data processing framework that allows us to efficiently handle and analyze large datasets.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the weather analysis, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- **Hadoop:** Install Hadoop on your system. You can download it from the [official website](https://hadoop.apache.org/).

- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Ensure that you have JDK 8 or later installed.

- **A weather dataset:** You will need a large weather dataset in a format that can be processed by Hadoop. This dataset should include information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and location.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamchaitanya7/weather-analysis-hadoop.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd weather-analysis-hadoop
```

## Data Source
You can use any weather dataset that suits your needs. Ensure that the dataset is in a structured format, such as CSV, and contains relevant weather data. You may consider using publicly available weather data sources or create your custom dataset.

## Data Preparation
Before running the analysis, you need to prepare the data for processing by Hadoop. Follow these steps:

1. Place your weather dataset file in the data/ directory of this project.
2. Modify the Hadoop MapReduce code in the src/ directory to parse and process your specific weather dataset format. Customize the data parsing logic in the Mapper and Reducer classes.
3. Compile the Java code by running the following command:
   
```bash
  javac -classpath $HADOOP_HOME/share/hadoop/common/hadoop-common-x.x.x.jar:$HADOOP_HOME/share/hadoop/mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-client-core-x.x.x.jar -d classes src/*.java
```
Replace x.x.x with your Hadoop version.

4. Create a JAR file from the compiled classes:
   
```bash
jar -cvf weather-analysis.jar -C classes .
```

## Running the Analysis
Now that the data is prepared and the JAR file is created, you can run the weather analysis using Hadoop. Follow these steps:

1. Upload your weather dataset to the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). Use the following command, replacing input_path with the path to your dataset and hdfs_input_path with the HDFS destination:

```bash
hdfs dfs -copyFromLocal input_path hdfs_input_path
```

2. Run the Hadoop MapReduce job:

```bash
hadoop jar weather-analysis.jar MainClass hdfs_input_path hdfs_output_path
```
Replace MainClass with the main class that contains your MapReduce job logic, hdfs_input_path with the HDFS path to your input data, and hdfs_output_path with the desired HDFS output directory.

3. Monitor the job progress by visiting the Hadoop web interface or using Hadoop command-line tools.

## Results
After the analysis is complete, you can retrieve the results from the HDFS output directory. Analyze and visualize the data as needed to draw meaningful insights from the weather dataset.
